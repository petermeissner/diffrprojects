## Re-submission

- Your complaints:
    - "as wells as" is a typo; please fix.  
    - The whole sentence looks a little strange; you could probably word it more clearly (but I'll only ask for the typo to be fixed, the other is optional).
    
    
- actions taken and response
    - Thanks.
    - typo is fixed 
    - description field should be more intelligible and informative now
